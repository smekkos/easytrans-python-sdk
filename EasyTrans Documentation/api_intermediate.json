    "description": "Base URL : https://www.mytrans.nl/demo/api Welcome to the EasyTrans REST API documentation! REST API to communicate with the EasyTrans Transport Management System. This documentation explains the various endpoints that are available. As you scroll down, you will see code examples for working with the API in different programming languages. Every EasyTrans account has its own URL and therefore also its own API base URL. The API URL is made up out of the following parts: https://www.YOUR_SERVER/YOUR_ENVIRONMENT/api/v1/ Please make sure that you have the correct URL of your carrier when you start making requests. If you are unsure which URL to use, please contact EasyTrans Software. Please note: The REST API is not active by default. A request for activation can be done by sending an e-mail to the address in the Contact section below. Non-backward compatible API changes will result in a new v2 URL, which will lead to updated API documentation. For now, only /api/v1/ is active. New and updated functionality in this API version can be found in the Changelog below. The EasyTrans API is only accessible through HTTPS and requests and responses are always JSON formatted. This API is written for three types of users: 1. EasyTrans users (branch accounts) Branch accounts are mainly used to connect EasyTrans to other systems that the carrier uses, such as CRM or WMS software, or a customized Web Portal. 2. The customers of EasyTrans users (customer accounts) Customer accounts are generally used to connect Web shops, ERP systems or any other software that the carrier’s customer uses. 3. The carriers of EasyTrans users (carrier accounts) Carrier accounts are used by the final party that carries out the transport. A carrier account is generally used to provide updates about the status of an order. Some methods and data are only available to specific accounts, such as customer data or order updates by carrier. A maximum of 60 requests per minute is allowed. A 429 Too Many Requests response will be given if the amount is exceeded. The EasyTrans API is a work in progress. We add new functionality based on the needs of our customers. Is information currently missing or do you need certain functionality that is not yet available? Please contact us to discuss the possibilities. Contact For more information about our API, you can contact EasyTrans via: Netherlands/Belgium: www.easytrans.nl - info@easytrans.nl United Kingdom: www.easytrans.co.uk - info@easytrans.co.uk php",

A combination of filters is also allowed. For some filters you can filter on multiple values by separating them with a comma. For example: ?filter[orderNo]=1,2,3 You can also use the following operators on any integer or date type filter, by placing them behind the name of the filter: [gte] = Greater than or equal [gt] = Greater than [lte] = Less than or equal [lt] = Less than [neq] = Not equal For example: ?filter[date][gte]=2023-12-01 returns all orders with an order date starting from this date. Operators can also be combined. For example: ?filter[orderNo][gte]=1000&filter[orderNo][lt]=2000 returns all orders between 1000 and 1999. The result can be sorted by the sort names below.

It is generally used to let a carrier sign-off an order and provide POD information. Only the body parameters below can be updated. Only orders that are open for editing can be updated (finished orders cannot be changed). The response contains the updated order. Update destinations A destination can be updated by providing the addressId (or stopNo) together with the body parameters that need to be changed. For a simple order with only one pickup and one delivery address, stopNo 2 is updated to sign-off an order. StopNo 1 can be updated to inform the carrier the goods have been loaded. For a multi stop order, several destinations need to be updated in order to update the POD information for each location. The destinations property expects an array. This allows updating of multiple destinations in one request. See the example request on how to edit a destination.",
